**TO DO**

- Create a node app that implements a set of REST APIs allowing CRUD functionality for an employee resource.

**Expected Time**

This exercise is expected to take a couple hours. We know everyone is busy and we don't want you to spend too much of your time.

**Submission Instructions**

Post your solution to a repository on GitHub (public or private) and send the repository URL back to us. (If it's private, make us a collaborator so we can clone it)

**Additional Instructions**

You don't need to use a database unless you want to, a database object variable is sufficient.

Use any NPM packages you find useful.

We use TypeScript, so bonus points if you're familiar with it and want to use it on this project. (but don't worry, it can be a lot to configure TS compiler options for Node)

Bonus points if you write tests.

**Expected Endpoints**

All CRUD functionality on the following resource: (You can implement more obscure HTTP requests, but they're not necessary)

/api/employees
